# Installation Instructions for Intelligent Indexing On Premises Version 2

## Introduction

This document describes the installation of DocuWare Intelligent Indexing and all additional
components required. Instructions for configuring Intelligent Indexing and working with
Intelligent Indexing are available as separate documents in the
[DocuWare Knowledge Center](https://help.docuware.com).

### System Requirements

The following minimum requirements must be met for installation:

- Windows Server 2019 (Standard or Datacenter Edition)
- 2 processor cores
- 4 GB RAM
- Optional: Access to SQL Server 2019

It is recommended that you install Intelligent Indexing on a separate server to achieve
the best possible performance. In order to keep the footprint of the installation small,
you should take Windows Server Core (which is an installation without a graphical UI).
If you install Intelligent Indexing on a machine together with other services,
you should ensure that no other application is using port 8080.

Intelligent Indexing can be used in combination with all
[supported DocuWare Versions](https://support.docuware.com/en-US/support/docuware-support-lifecycle-policy/).
If you use SQL Server 2019 for your DocuWare system or for an existing
Intelligent Indexing installation, you can also use it for Intelligent Indexing V2.
Otherwise, you must set up a separate SQL server.

The installation requires administrator rights and internet connection.
All commands in following instructions must be entered in the PowerShell. You can use
PowerShell 5 or PowerShell 7.

> :bulb: If you want to run the scripts in the PowerShell ISE, please ensure that
> the current directory in the ISE is changed to the __scripts__ directory
> the extracted setup files.

### Overview of the Required Files

The installation files can be downloaded from
[our GitHub repository](https://github.com/DocuWare/Intellix/archive/master.zip).
After the ZIP file is downloaded, extract it.

You can also download and extract the file with the following PowerShell script.
First switch to the target directory for the download with PowerShell:

```powershell
$tmp = New-TemporaryFile | Rename-Item -NewName { $_ -replace 'tmp$', 'zip' } -PassThru
Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/DocuWare/Intellix/archive/master.zip -OutFile $tmp
Expand-Archive $tmp -DestinationPath master
$tmp | Remove-Item
```

To install and run Intelligent Indexing, the content of the `scripts` directory is required.
Copy this directory to a location that you want to use permanently.

> :point_up: When you download the archive with a browser, you should consider unblocking
> the archive before extracting the files.
> Otherwise, there could be callbacks popping up when the setup is executed.
> To unblock the archive file, right click the archive and disable the blocking in the
> file properties window.
>
> If the files are already extracted, then you can switch to the
> extraction directory and run in PowerShell:
>  ```powershell
>  Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Unblock-File
>  ```

An overview of the individual files can be found
[at the end of this document](#overview-of-the-intelligent-indexing-setup-files).
You also need your DocuWare license file, which you can download from the
[DocuWare Partner Portal](http://go.docuware.com/partnerportal-login).

### Docker Containerization

Intelligent Indexing runs in Docker containers. A setup script configures the containers,
so that the installation effort for Intelligent Indexing Version 2 is therefore very low.

The Docker containers are:

- __intellix-app__: The Intelligent Indexing service
- __intellix-solr__: The SolR full text search engine
- __intellix-sql__: In case you do not want to use your SQL Server installation,
  we provide an SQL Express in a container.

### Overview of the Instructions

The installation is divided into the following steps:

- [Allowing Execution of Scripts](#allowing-execution-of-scripts)
- [Installation of the Docker Environment](#installation-of-the-docker-environment)
- [Installation of the Database Server](#installation-of-the-database-server)
- [Setup](#setup)
- [Installation of the IIS Web Server](#installation-of-the-iis-web-server)
- [Management of Intelligent Indexing](#management-of-intelligent-indexing)
- [Licensing Intelligent Indexing](#licensing-intelligent-indexing)
- [Connecting DocuWare with Intelligent Indexing](#connecting-docuware-with-intelligent-indexing)
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

## Allowing Execution of Scripts

By default, Windows Server prevents PowerShell scripts from running.
The permissions therefore need to be adjusted for the installation process.

To check the current setting, run the following command in PowerShell as administrator:

```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```

If the result is displayed as `Unrestricted`, you do not need to change anything.
If a value other than `Unrestricted` is displayed, you must use the
following command to allow unsigned scripts to run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force
```

After executing the command, all commands can be executed in the __current PowerShell session__.
You have to execute this command again in every PowerShell window.

If you want to remove the block completely, you can also use
`CurrentUser` or `LocalMachine` as the scope.

## Installation of the Docker Environment

Intelligent Indexing runs in Docker containers. Therefore, a Docker environment
needs to be installed. Also `docker-compose` must be installed. We provide a script
which executes the necessary steps.
In PowerShell as administrator,
switch to the installation directory and run the following command:

```powershell
# Only necessary if the PowerShell execution policy is not 'Unrestricted.'
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force

.\Install-Docker.ps1
```

If the installation script reports that the computer should be restarted you can run:

```powershell
Restart-Computer
```

After the reboot you can test if the Docker environment and docker-compose are installed correctly:

```cmd
docker run --rm --name helloworld hello-world:nanoserver
```

After the Docker image is downloaded and launched, you should see the following output:

```text
Hello from Docker!

This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
```

If you run

```cmd
docker-compose --version
```

you should see the line

```text
docker-compose version...
```

## Installation of the Database Server

For the database you can choose from the following options:

### Option 1: Use the SQL Server Express which comes as container image

This is recommended for most installations.
In this scenario, the installation of Intelligent Indexing is very simple, because no further
configuration of the database server is needed. You do not need to care about the
database setup and configuration - this is fully managed by the setup script.

However, SQL Express limits the size of the stored data. If you expect a very high data volume
(i.e. several thousands documents each day) then you should go for the other option.
If the size limit becomes a problem later, you can migrate to your own database server.

### Option 2: Use your own database server

You should choose this option if you expect a high volume of documents,
or if you want to have full control of the Intelligent Indexing database.
Intelligent Indexing expects SQL Server 2019. On older
versions of SQL Server, the setup fails. If you use a SQL Server 2019 for your
DocuWare system, you can also use it for Intelligent Indexing.

If you want to setup your own SQL Server, you can start with an installation of
[SQL Server 2019 Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).
Download it and follow the setup instructions.

It is important, that your SQL Server is configured like this:

- TCP Connections on port 1433.
- SQL Server authentication must be enabled.
  The containers do not support integrated authentication.
- A SQL Server account should be available for the setup script.
  This account must have the permission to create a new database.
- The firewall must have the ports configured so that the Docker
  containers can connect to the database.

Note that Intelligent Indexing requires self-contained databases.
Therefore, the following SQL is executed by the setup script:

```sql
sp_configure 'contained database authentication', 1
GO
RECONFIGURE
GO
```

If this is not what you want, you should install a separate
SQL Server instance for Intelligent Indexing.

## Setup

The Intelligent Indexing setup configures the database and the container infrastructure.
When the setup runs, some container images are pulled and the container,
which contains the database setup, is built and executed.

The setup creates a directory structure at `C:\ProgramData\IntellixV2`,
which is used to persist the data for Intelligent Indexing.
Please consider this directory in you backups, use junctions to mount this
directory to an external storage.

The setup is triggered by running the `Setup-Intellix.ps1` in the `setup` folder.
You can apply the following parameters:

- `IntellixDbUser` and `IntellixDbPassword`: These are the database credentials that
  Intelligent Indexing will use to access the database.
  You should use a strong password which matches the
  [SQL Server password policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/password-policy?view=sql-server-ver15).
  These values need be specified only on the initial setup.

  This SQL account with the specified credentials is created in the intellixv2 database,
  and no logins are created on your SQL Server.
  
  :bulb: These values should be specified on the initial setup only.
  If you run the setup a second time, the values are not needed anymore.  

- `IntellixAdminUser` and `IntellixAdminPassword`: These are the credentials that DocuWare
  uses to access Intelligent Indexing. The password should be secure, but should not contain any
  of the following 5 special characters, as these can cause problems in the connection file:
  `& < > " '`.
  
  :bulb: These values should be specified on the initial setup only.
  If you run the setup a second time, the values are not needed anymore.

- `LicenseFile`: The path to the license file. If the license file is not specified on the setup,
  it can be uploaded after the setup in the Intelligent Indexing UI.

  :bulb: To make the service ready to use right after the installation,
  it is recommended to specify the
  license file when running the setup. If you do not have a license file, visit the
  [DocuWare Partner Portal](http://go.docuware.com/partnerportal-login).

- `SqlServerInstance`, `SqlServerInstanceUser` and `SqlServerInstancePassword`:
  These values specify the instance and the credentials to access your own SQL Server.
  
  :warning: If you use the containerized SQL Server, you must not pass these parameters.

If you run an old version of Intelligent Indexing On Premises on the same
database server, you can install
Intelligent Indexing Version 2 in parallel. The old version uses the
`intellix` database, the current version uses the `intellixv2` database.
  
### Examples

There are two example scripts `Run-Setup-Example.ps1` and
`Run-Setup-With-Own-SqlServer-Example.ps1` provided. You can modify the scripts and use them
to run the setup and start the service when the setup is finished.

In order to get strong passwords, these scripts use a password generator to generate passwords
for the Web UI and the database user.
If you do not like to generate random passwords, just modify the examples
depending on your need.

- Simple Intelligent Indexing installation with license file:
  
  ```powershell
  # Only necessary if the PowerShell execution policy is not 'Unrestricted.'
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force

  $intellixAdminPassword = ./Get-RandomPassword.ps1
  $intellixDbPassword = ./Get-RandomPassword.ps1

  ./setup/Setup-Intellix.ps1 `
      -IntellixAdminUser intellix `
      -IntellixAdminPassword $intellixAdminPassword `
      -IntellixDbUser intellix `
      -IntellixDbPassword $intellixDbPassword `
      -LicenseFile 'c:\users\Administrator\Downloads\Peters Engineering_Enterprise.lic'

  Write-Output "Intelligent Indexing Web UI user: intellix"
  Write-Output "Intelligent Indexing Web UI password: $intellixAdminPassword"
  ```

- Installing Intelligent Indexing with your own SQL Server,
but without license file:

  ```powershell
  # Only necessary if the PowerShell execution policy is not 'Unrestricted.'
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force

  $intellixAdminPassword = ./Get-RandomPassword.ps1
  $intellixDbPassword = ./Get-RandomPassword.ps1

  ./setup/Setup-Intellix.ps1 `
      -IntellixAdminUser intellix `
      -IntellixAdminPassword $intellixAdminPassword `
      -IntellixDbUser intellix `
      -IntellixDbPassword $intellixDbPassword `
      -SqlServerInstance my-sql-2019-box `
      -SqlServerInstanceUser "sa" `
      -SqlServerInstancePassword "Admin001"

  Write-Output "Intelligent Indexing Web UI user: intellix"
  Write-Output "Intelligent Indexing Web UI password: $intellixAdminPassword"
  ```

## Installation of the IIS Web Server

To install, run the following script in PowerShell as
administrator in the installation directory:

```powershell
# Only necessary if the PowerShell execution policy is not 'Unrestricted.'
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force

.\Install-IIS.ps1
```

The script installs the IIS web server with the components `UrlRewrite` and `ARR`.

If you want to use a connection via `https`, you must click `Bindings...` on the right in the IIS
interface under `Sites` → `Default Web Site`, enter a valid certificate
there under the `https` binding, and save the certificate in the corresponding
certificate stores. In the connection file
(see [Connecting DocuWare with Intelligent Indexing](#connecting-docuware-with-intelligent-indexing))
you can then enter `https` instead of `http`.

## Management of Intelligent Indexing

### Configuration of Intelligent Indexing

The setup generates files, which are used by the containers to connect to the
database and to store the files and the index data for Apache Solr. The data
is stored at `C:\ProgramData\IntellixV2`. If you want to store the data
at a different location, we recommend to move the folder to a location of
your choice and create junctions or soft links using the
[mklink](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mklink)
command or with `New-Item`:

```powershell
Stop-Intellix.ps1
Move-Item -Path C:\ProgramData\IntellixV2 -Destination d:\a-lot-of-space\intellixv2

New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path C:\ProgramData\IntellixV2 `
  -Value d:\a-lot-of-space\intellixv2

Start-Intellix.ps1
```

### Starting Intelligent Indexing

To start Intelligent Indexing, run the following script in PowerShell as
administrator in the installation directory:

```powershell
# Only necessary if the PowerShell execution policy is not 'Unrestricted.'
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force

.\Start-Intellix.ps1
```

### Testing the Components of Intelligent Indexing

You can use the following script to check which Docker containers are
currently running on the host computer:

```powershell
docker ps -a
```

You should get one line each as output for the Docker containers whose names start with __intellix__.
In the `Status` column, you can see whether the Docker containers are running (`Up...`)
or have been ended (`Exited...`). You can also see in this column whether the containers
are accessible in principle. At startup, (`health: starting`) is displayed here.
If the containers respond successfully to requests, (`healthy`) is displayed.

You can check with PowerShell if the service runs. The following request
should be responded with status code 200:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing http://localhost:8080/intellix-v2/
```

If this succeeds, you can navigate to <http://localhost:8080/intellix-v2/Html>
on the host computer to call up the administration interface.

> :warning: Internet Explorer is not supported.

You can log in with the user name and password you specified via the parameters
`IntellixAdminUser` and `IntellixAdminPassword` in setup.

Also test here whether you can access the host computer via a browser from the computer on which
DocuWare is installed. From another computer, call up the URL
http://_computername_/intellix-v2/Html/, replacing _\_computername\__
with the name of the host computer.

### Logging

To view the live log of Intelligent Indexing, run the following PowerShell script:

```powershell
# Only necessary if the PowerShell execution policy is not 'Unrestricted.'
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force

.\Show-IntellixLogs.ps1
```

The output can be canceled by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

### Stopping Intelligent Indexing

To stop Intelligent Indexing, run the following script in PowerShell script:

```powershell
# Only necessary if the PowerShell execution policy is not 'Unrestricted.'
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force

.\Stop-Intellix.ps1
```

### Updating Intelligent Indexing

DocuWare is constantly improving Intelligent indexing. To apply the updates, it is enough to pull
updated images and restart the service.

Use the following script to check for and download any updates or hotfixes for Intelligent Indexing:

```powershell
# Only necessary if the PowerShell execution policy is not 'Unrestricted.'
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force

.\Update-Intellix.ps1
```

You can run this script while Intelligent Indexing is running. The changes will not take effect until you
run `Stop-Intellix.ps1` and `Start-Intellix.ps1` after this script is finished.
This services can be restarted immediately after the update if the `WithRestart`parameter is added:

```powershell
# Only necessary if the PowerShell execution policy is not 'Unrestricted.'
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force

.\Update-Intellix.ps1 -WithRestart
```

### Restarting the Host Computer

The Docker environment manages the running Intelligent Indexing containers. These are configured so that
Intelligent Indexing shuts down and automatically restarts when the host computer is rebooted. If
Intelligent Indexing was not running before the restart, it will not start after the restart.

## Licensing Intelligent Indexing

To use Intelligent Indexing, you must apply a license file to the service.
You can download the license file from the
[DocuWare Partner Portal](http://go.docuware.com/partnerportal-login).

If you have the file downloaded, we recommend to pass the file when
[configuring](#setup) Intelligent Indexing. Alternatively,
you can upload the file in the Intelligent Indexing Web UI at the _Licensing_ section.

## Connecting DocuWare with Intelligent Indexing

The setup generates a connection file for DocuWare. The installation directory
contains this file at `.\setup\run\intelligent-indexing-connection.xml`.

This file contains the connection URL. In case your server is exposed with a different name
than the machine name, or you configured the IIS to use `https`, you should change this URL in this file.

You can now upload the Intelligent Indexing connection file to your DocuWare installation to establish
the connection with Intelligent Indexing. To do this, log in to DocuWare Administration and
navigate to `DocuWare System` → `Data Connections` → `Intelligent Indexing Service connections`.
If a connection is already entered here, you can open it, remove your organization
under _Organizations_, and click `Apply`. This disables the connection of your
DocuWare system to your old Intelligent Indexing system, but it can be reactivated
by adding the organization again. Then right-click `Intelligent Indexing Service connections`
on the left side and select `Install Intelligent Indexing Service file`.
In the dialog that opens, select the `intelligent-indexing-connection.xml`
file. Then click `Apply` and close the DocuWare Administration.

> :point_up: When you upload the configuration file in the DocuWare Configuration, you may receive an error message, saying Intelligent Indexing cannot be connected.
However, this message is misleading, and the connection is established. We fix this wrong message in a future version of DocuWare.

## Troubleshooting

### Database Setup fails

In case the setup fails, you should enable the _verbose output_
of PowerShell and then run the setup again.
This can be enabled with:

```powershell
$VerbosePreference = "Continue"
$InformationPreference = "Continue"
```

### IIS installation and ARR installation fails

In case the IIS installation fails, or any other module installation fails, you should restart the
machine. Pending Windows updates may stop the configuration of the IIS. A machine restart solves this problem
in many cases.

### Hints for Beta test users

- If you have Intelligent Indexing v2 already installed from an earlier beta test,
  please remove running or stopped Intelligent Indexing containers.
  You should then update or recreate the database by running the [Setup](#setup).
  We moved the Intelligent Indexing data files to `C:\ProgramData\IntellixV2`.

- We simplified the SQL Server installation.
  If you have SQL Express already installed, you can consider replacing the installed SQL Server
  with a containerized SQL Server. You can also continue with the installed SQL Server. Find the
  details at [Installation of the Database Server](#installation-of-the-database-server).
